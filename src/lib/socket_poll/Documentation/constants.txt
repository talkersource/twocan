Section: Constants you pass to the socket_poll_cntl_opt() function

Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_GET_MAP_TYPE

 Parameter[1]: value holder
 Type[1]: struct Socket_poll_cntl_ret_int *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the value for the option _MAP_TYPE.
  Currently this can either be SOCKET_POLL_TYPE_MAP_COMPRESSED or
 SOCKET_POLL_TYPE_MAP_DIRECT.

 Note:

  The value of this option is initially undefined, so if you _need_ a certain
 type then you should call set with _MAP_TYPE.


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_SET_MAP_TYPE

 Parameter[1]: value
 Type[1]: int

 Explanation:

  This option will set the value for the option flag _MAP_TYPE.
  Currently this can either be SOCKET_POLL_TYPE_MAP_COMPRESSED or
 SOCKET_POLL_TYPE_MAP_DIRECT.

  This is the flag which chooses whether the offsets returned from
 socket_poll_add() are directly related to the fd you pass in (Ie. they are
 fd + 1) or whether they are completely unrelated.
  Each choice has it's pros and cons.
  Directly mapped offsets are less CPU intensive on _add() and _del(), but can
 be more memory intensive and if they are are likely to be more CPU intensive
 on a call to _update_all().
  Compressed mapped offsets work the other way, there is a CPU hit on _add()
 and _del() but they will use less memory.

 Note:

  If you want to do socket_poll_add() on an fd many times, then it's worth
 noting that if you use direct mapping then you can only do it 255 times (why
 you'd want to do it anywhere near this ammount is beyond me) after which it
 will always fail. However if you wish to do it 255 times or less then direct
 mapping will always return the same offset and so use many times less memory.
  Ie. If you do 4 socket_poll_add()'s per fd then compressed mapping will use
 4 offsets and direct mapping will use 1.
  However in the case of multiple fd's the reurn value from
 socket_poll_update_all() will be 1, not 4, in the above example.


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_GET_MAP_COMPRESSED_GROW

 Parameter[1]: value holder
 Type[1]: struct Socket_poll_cntl_ret_size_t *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the value of the _MAP_COMPRESSED_GROW number.


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_SET_MAP_COMPRESSED_GROW

 Parameter[1]: value
 Type[1]: size_t

 Explanation:

  This option will set the value of the _MAP_COMPRESSED_GROW number.
  This number controls how much of a block to grow the mapping by when using
 compressed mapping (and you socket_poll needs to allocate at least one offset
 entry).


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_GET_MAP_SIZE

 Parameter[1]: value holder
 Type[1]: struct Socket_poll_cntl_ret_size_t *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the value of the current size of the indicators array.


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_SET_MAP_SIZE

 Parameter[1]: value
 Type[1]: size_t

 Explanation:

  This option will set the value of the indicators array (and hence realloc
 the array).


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_GET_MAP_END_SIZE

 Parameter[1]: value holder
 Type[1]: struct Socket_poll_cntl_ret_size_t *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the value of the current size of the unused block of
 memory at the end of the indicators array.


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_SET_MAP_END_SIZE

 Parameter[1]: value
 Type[1]: size_t

 Explanation:

  This option will set the value of the indicators array (and hence realloc
 the array) by taking the input and adding the size of the used part to it.
  So passing the value 0 will realloc() the array to have no unused space at
 the end.

 Note:

  This function, combined with _CNTL_OPT_GET_MAP_ARRAY, is useful for
 "wrapping" an implementation of poll().


Constant: SOCKET_POLL_CNTL_OPT_GET_MAP_END_ARRAY

 Parameter[1]: value holder
 Type[1]: struct Socket_poll_cntl_ret_void_ptr *

 Explanation:

  This option will get a pointer to the end of the indicators array, 
 equivilant to SOCKET_POLL_INDICATORS(max) (where max is the offset directly
 after the last offset that has been given out).

 Note:

  This function is probably only useful so that you can "wrap" poll()
 implementations.
