
   INTRODUCTION

 All functions are documented in functions.txt, all constants are
in constants.txt and the namespace rules are in namespace.txt (fancy that).

Basically you should be able to get an overview of a function by looking at
the functions.txt file, and be able to get a deeper understanding by looking
in the constants.txt file (Ie. all constants should be passed to a function
listed, so the more detailed information is listed with the constants -- not
the functions).


   A VERY SIMPLE OVERVIEW

 A very simple overview is that you create a Socket_poll_typedef_offset by
passing an fd to socket_poll_add(). You can then use it via.
SOCKET_POLL_INDICATOR() as a normal (struct pollfd *) and by calling
socket_poll_update_all(), instead of poll().
