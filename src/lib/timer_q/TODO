
 Spec file for rpm.
 Whatever the same thing is for deps ?

 A couple more examples would be nice.

 Split the timer_q.c file up a bit more ?

 Sort out the /usr/include/../include/ mess 
  (Ie. add a makefile in the include dir, but it isn't that easy because 
       automake then decides to run autoheader for you -- gee thanks).

 HTML documentation ?
