
   INTRODUCTION

 All functions are documented in functions.txt, all constants are
in constants.txt and the namespace rules are in namespace.txt (fancy that).

Basically you should be able to get an overview of a function by looking at
the functions.txt file, and be able to get a deeper understanding by looking
in the constants.txt file (Ie. all constants should be passed to a function
listed, so the more detailed information is listed with the constants -- not
the functions). Also if you used the development version of this library you
should read the compatability.txt document as some of the symbol names changed.


   A VERY SIMPLE OVERVIEW

 A _very_ simple overview is that you create a (Timer_q_base *) as the base
of all your timed events. Then whenever you want a timed event you create a
(Timer_q_node *) in the (Timer_q_base *). This will then "go off" when you
call timer_q_run_norm() with a time equal, or greater, than the one the timer
should go off at. It will also "go off" if you call timer_q_run_all() and you
created the (Timer_q_base *) with the TIMER_Q_FLAG_BASE_RUN_ALL flag.

 The only other bit of information which doesn't really fit anyway, is that
you are allow to _read_ the (Timer_q_base *)->num to find out how many
nodes are in that base -- setting this value isn't allowed though and may or
may not have any effect (and that effect may or may not be for the library to
crash).

 Also note that you might want to have a look at the examples/ directory
ex1.c is the most simple usage, ex2.c is more complicated etc.
