 I wanted to use gtk-doc (or gdoc ?), but was unable to get it to run
(I'm currently using a hacked slackware 2 :O ... and there seems to be _no_
documentation on gtk-doc at all).

</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>

 So after waiting and looking for a long time I just opened up a text editor
and started writting, so don't expect the documentation it to look nice ... 
however it is actualy here so count your blessings etc. (Yeh I know no-one
is actually reading this anyway so it doesn't matter, but...)

 All functions are documented in <a href="functions.html">functions.html</a>, all constants are
in <a href="constants.html">constants.html</a> and the namespace rules are in <a href="namespace.html">namespace.html</a> (fancy that). Also if you used the
development version of this library you should read the 
<a href="compatability.html">compatability.html</a> document as some of the
symbol names changed.

</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>

Basically you should be able to get an overview of a function by looking at
the functions.html file, and be able to get a deeper understanding by looking
in the constants.html file (Ie. all constants should be passed to a function
listed, so the more detailed information is listed with the constants -- not
the functions).

<table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#DDDDFF">
	  <h2>A very simple overview</h2>
	</td></tr></table>

<table width="80%"><tr><td><p>

 A _very_ simple overview is that you create a (Timer_q_base *) as the base
of all your timed events. Then whenever you want a timed event you create a
(Timer_q_node *) in the (Timer_q_base *). This will then "go off" when you
call timer_q_run_norm() with a time equal, or greater, than the one the timer
should go off at. It will also "go off" if you call timer_q_run_all() and you
created the (Timer_q_base *) with the TIMER_Q_FLAG_BASE_RUN_ALL flag.

</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>

 The only other bit of information which doesn't really fit anyway, is that
you are allow to _read_ the (Timer_q_base *)->num to find out how many
nodes are in that base -- setting this value isn't allowed though and may or
may not have any effect (and that effect may or may not be for the library to
crash).

</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>

 Also note that you might want to have a look at the examples/ directory
ex1.c is the most simple usage, ex2.c is more complicated etc.
