
 There were some last minute changes at version 1.0.0 from 0.9.0, these
should be pretty easy to fix and were made to make things clearer. 0.9.0 was
a development release, so this isn't a problem ... this is now a stable
release and so won't be happening again.

 These are the old and the new symbol names:
